        Using drugs, alcohol or tobacco in high school can cause severe long-term effects. Trying any of these before
        the age of 21 significantly raises the risk of developing an addiction or drug dependence.
        Did you know that your brain develops until the age of 25? Anything that you do to disrupt this
        process—including substance—will affect how your brain develops.

        During the brain’s development stage, any type of trauma and/or changes in the brain’s wiring could affect brain
        function. Drug use is one of the ways that can mess up the wiring. How?
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        According to NIDA, the brain relies on chemicals called <strong>neurotransmitters</strong> to get messages from
        one part of the
        brain to the other. Each neurotransmitter attaches to its own kind of receptor—like how a key fits into a lock.
        This allows messages to travel through the brain on the right path. <strong>When you use drugs, it interferes
          with the
          normal traffic patterns that the neurotransmitters use.</strong> The chemical structure in the drugs can
        imitate and fool
        the receptors, lock on to them and alter the activity of the nerve cells. This “alteration” can result in
        messages going in the wrong direction, and reset the way your brain should act or react.

        Ultimately this affects the way your brain processes and retains information—and how you think, learn, remember,
        focus, and concentrate.

        Research shows that there is a definite link between teen substance abuse and how well you do in school.
        <strong> Teens
          who abuse drugs have lower grades, a higher rate of absence from school and other activities, and an increased
          potential for dropping out of school.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Studies show that marijuana, for example, affects your attention, memory, and ability to learn. Its effects can
        last for days or weeks after the drug wears off. So, if you are smoking marijuana daily, you are not functioning
        at your best.

        Students who smoke marijuana tend to get lower grades and are more likely to drop out of high school. One recent
        marijuana study showed that <strong> heavy marijuana use in your teen years and continued into adulthood can
          reduce your
          IQ up to as much as 8 points.</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        High school dropout rates have also risen as a result of substance abuse.
        A study of teens in 12th grade (16-18 years of age) who dropped out of school before graduation are more likely
        than their peers to be users of cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and other illicit drugs.
        Teens who smoke, drink alcohol, binge drink or use marijuana or other drugs are more likely than non-users to
        drop out of school and less likely than non-users to graduate from high school, attend college or obtain a
        college degree. One study found that nearly one-third of school dropouts indicate that their use of alcohol or
        other drugs was an important contributor in their decision to leave school.
