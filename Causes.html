      <p style="font-size: 21px;">
        There are many different possible causes of teen drug use. Many are reacting to peer pressure and believe that
        turning to drugs and alcohol is how to become popular in high school. Some use drugs to self-medicate from
        painful feelings.

        Some teens even turn to “study aid” drugs like Adderall or Ritalin, because they believe these substances will
        boost their academic performance. High school is often the first time that kids encounter illicit substances,
        and their curiosity often gets the better of them.
      </p>
      <h3>Peer Pressure</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        Peer pressure is influence from the people in one’s social group or setting. Not all peer pressure is bad,
        though. This influence can cause people to act more responsibly or join a sports team, for example. However,
        usually, when peer pressure is discussed, it is negative and often is tied to bullying.

        Teens face an overwhelming amount of peer pressure in high school, from their classmates and friends. Peer
        pressure during adolescence often involves risky behaviors, such as trying drugs or alcohol. Teenagers may feel
        as though they need to give in to this pressure to fit in socially.
      </p>
      <h3>Academic Pressure</h3>
      <p style="font-size: 17px;">
        High school is an exceptionally busy and stressful period of life, and academic pressure in high school is very
        high. Students face harder classes and are gearing up to go to college or start a career. The pressure to get
        good grades, do well on entrance exams and succeed in extracurricular activities comes from both parents and
        teachers.

        Overwhelmed by homework and studying, teens sometimes turn to performance-enhancing drugs to boost their energy
        and concentration. They might also take drugs to help them sleep better under stress. Taken without a
        prescription, these drugs can become addictive and can cause dangerous health effects.
